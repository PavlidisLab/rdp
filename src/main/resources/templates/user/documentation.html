                                            and click "Apply". Copy and paste the resulting list of

                                            Once you have added some genes, you can optionally
                                            provide some Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to your
                                            work. Genes associated with the GO terms you select will
                                            be considered a "third Tier" of genes for possible use in
                                            identifying researchers who can study a particular gene.

                                            If you have already entered at least two genes, the
                                            system can suggest related GO terms for you. The system
                                            uses a very simple algorithm to do this. We look at GO
                                            terms shared by the genes you have entered. If a term has
                                            enough genes overlapping with your genes, it is
                                            considered a candidate. We then prune terms that are too
                                            big, too small or highly redundant with another candidate
                                            term. A selection of the top candidates is then provided.
                                            The full process is a little more involved than this,
                                            as it makes use of the structure of the GO hierarchy and
                                            several heuristics to provide useful results. Please <a th:href="@{/user/support}">Contact
