                                            If you have already entered at least two genes, the system can suggest
                                            related GO terms for you. The system uses a very simple algorithm to do
                                            this. We look at GO terms shared by the genes you have entered. If a term
                                            has enough genes overlapping with your genes, it is considered a candidate.
                                            We then prune terms that are too big, too small or highly redundant with
                                            another candidate term. A selection of the top candidates is then provided.
                                            The full process is a little more involved than this, as it makes use of the
                                            structure of the GO hierarchy and several heuristics to provide useful
                                            results. Please <a th:href="@{/user/support}">Contact Us</a> if you would

                                                search for registered users based on genes they study. Gene symbols are
                                                system-specific and will be matched against the list of known gene
                                                symbols for the selected system (selection made in a dropdown menu).
                                                If you want to search for a match using a human gene, but consider
                                                orthologs in other model systems, you would use the secondary
                                                dropdown menu to indicate the preferred system.
