rdp.site.welcome=<p>The {0} registry collects information on model organism researchers and the specific genes they \
study. The registry is the mechanism by which the {0} will find potential matches of model organism researchers to human \
rare disease researchers.</p> \
<p>The Registry collects two types of information. First, you will enter your basic contact information and some general \
information about your research (under "<a href="{1}">Profile</a>"). Second, you will enter information about genes you \
study, for one or more <b>Model Organisms</b>. Obtaining a correct and comprehensive list of genes is of key interest. \
In order to assist registrants in this regard we devised a three-tier gene model described. Please <a href="{2}#genes">read carefully</a> \
before you start adding genes to your profile.</p> \
<p>The default data privacy setting in the registry is "private" and, unless different data sharing preference is selected \
(under <a href="{1}">Profile</a>), the information you enter is <a href="{2}#privacy">confidential</a> and will only be \
used by the Network administration for matching you to rare disease research projects. Your information will not be shared \
with any third party (including other registered researchers) without your explicit consent.</p> \
